* flow-based architecture for machine, request-based architecture for data:
  - machine/rebuild: enum proc not flow-based (normal, rewrite code to use ACTION_ENUM)
  - cache/cache: get machine length not flow-based (not important, subject for deprecation)
  - machine/pool: pool get parameter not flow-based (not important for now, another approach?)

* m4 macro collection
  - write m4 macro for balancer machine

- write allocator_fixed_t push/pop same as for list_t
- list_t compare function, as multiselect_t would do
- broken tcp

- join physical and logical length into one
- machine 'data/buffer'

- review indexes and caches (+ data free routines)
- data 'refcount_t'
- data 'timerange_t'

- fix broken slice_t hash_dump's
- rewrite file_t to use fd_t

- review code for multi-threading support, document machine's thread-safety capabilities
- machine thread_pool
- machine multi_request

- new test suite, as benchmarks, deprecate check
- data 'range_t'
- machine queue

- deprecate data/transfer as useless
- deprecate cache, write cache_t instead

- pcre
- libev

- actions documentation
